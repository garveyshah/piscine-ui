# Color Codes Deliverable

## Overview

This deliverable is part of the UI Quest project. The objective was to extract color palettes (3-4 main colors) from seven websites. In this project, I utilized Figma's Color Pipette along with [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to accurately extract and refine the color codes from the websites’ main pages.

## Process & Methodology

1. **Website Selection:**  
   The following websites were analyzed:
   - [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/)
   - [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)
   - [Decathlon - Kids Gift Ideas](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/kids-gift-ideas)
   - [JR Pass](https://www.jrpass.com/)
   - [SIFF](https://www.thesiff.com/)
   - [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/es/)
   - [TED](https://www.ted.com/)

2. **Screenshot Capture:**  
   For each website, I captured a screenshot of the main page to preserve the visual context.

3. **Color Extraction:**  
   I used Figma’s Color Pipette to sample the primary colors from each screenshot. To further refine and verify the color codes, I employed [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/), ensuring that the extracted colors accurately reflect the original design.

4. **Figma File Layout:**  
   The Figma file is organized with a dedicated page for each website. Each page contains:
   - A screenshot of the website’s main page.
   - The URL of the website.
   - The extracted color palette, displayed using filled shapes.
   - The corresponding color codes (Hex/RGB).

## File Naming & Upload

The final Figma file has been uploaded to GitHub with the following naming convention:
```text
Ouma_Godwin_ColorCodesPrototype_04_03_2024_V1.fig
```

This ensures consistency and clarity in project versioning and identification.

## Design Considerations

- **Clarity & Simplicity:**  
  The design is minimalistic, ensuring that the focus remains on the color palettes and their codes.
  
- **Consistency:**  
  Each website is presented on a separate page with a uniform layout, facilitating easy comparison and review.

- **Tool Integration:**  
  Combining Figma's Color Pipette with Adobe Color allowed for precise and reliable color extraction.
